	\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Project Mandate}
    The objective of this project is to design, analyze and parametrize a functioning 4-wheeled, off-road vehicle in accordance with regulations stated in the Collegiate Design Series Baja \acrfull{SAE} Rules \cite{bajarules}. These regulations outline the acceptable vehicle components, build restrictions and prohibitions as well as specifications that ensure a minimum level of safety for the driver and everyone around the vehicle. 
    
    The Baja vehicles are designed and constructed by teams of university students. These teams can participate in multiple competitions across North America every year. During these competitions, the vehicles are put through different dynamic events to test the acceleration, hill climb, maneuverability and suspension. 
    
    As part of the project mandate, the design of the vehicle will be completed by two groups. One group must conceptualize all the component for the motion transfer and the other must design the remainder, such as the roll cage, suspension and steering. Both groups will work together as a team to design a complete and compliant Baja SAE vehicle.
    
    \subsection{Group Problem Scope}
    This group's objective is to design all non-motion transfer subsystems of the 4-wheeled, off-road vehicle in accordance to all regulations. The subsystems to be designed include the chassis, suspension, steering, body panels and anchor points. Additionally, all accessories and safety components such as the brake light, seat and seat tie points, and the mounting for the brake and gas pedals.
    
    The safety of the vehicle's operator is paramount. Therefore, all design selections must be made in favour of safety. The regulations must be strictly adhered to in order to produce a competitive and safe vehicle. The vehicle's chassis must be designed to eliminate all pinch and crush hazards presented by the suspension and steering systems, and separate the operator from the engine and fuel compartment. This report primarily deals with the design criteria and restrictions, concepts explored, cost assessment and decision making.
